    <h2>Scoring</h2>
    <p>Teams are ranked by the number of problems correctly solved. Try to solve as many problems as possible.</p>
    <p>To break ties, there is an additional &quot;penalty&quot; score. Here&apos;s an explanation:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        When you correctly solve a problem, one &quot;penalty&quot; point is added per minute since the start of the
        competition.
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <em>Ex:</em> If you correctly solve the first question 35 minutes into the competition, you will also earn
          35 &quot;penalty&quot; points. This means solving questions more quickly is better.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>
        If you submit an incorrect solution, 20 &quot;penalty&quot; points are added to your score for that problem.
        Try not to make too many incorrect submissions.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Competition Guidelines</h2>

      <li>
        Only virtual teams <b>may</b> use online communication software like email, Zoom, Teams, Skype, Discord, etc. for
        communication <b>solely between</b> you and your teammates.
      </li>
      <li>
        Your solutions have a runtime limit of <b>5 seconds</b>. When judging, solutions are stopped if they take
        longer than 5 seconds to execute.
      </li>
      <li>Ask questions regarding logistics and problems to the judges. This includes:</li>

    <h2>Other Notes</h2>
    <p>Some finals things to take note of:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The competition problems have <b>strict input and output formatting requirements</b>. Input and output
        should match exactly as they appear in the problem descriptions.
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>
            We highly recommend the use of the &quot;Skeletons&quot;, which can be found on each problem page
            underneath the &quot;Submit&quot; and &quot;Ask&quot; buttons.
          </b>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>
        Submit your source code file (<code>.java</code> or <code>.py</code>). <b>Do not</b> submit{' '}
        <code>.class</code> or <code>.pyc</code> files.
      </li>
      <li>
        If writing your submission in Java, do not use packages. Remove any <code>package...</code> statements from
        the top of your Java solution source code file before submitting.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>That is all! Thank you for taking the time to read the rules and happy programming!</p>
