        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          Teams of two to four students will be working together to solve a problem that is present in society and is
          awaiting a technological solution. The students then have three hours to develop a solution using their
          knowledge of computer science principles and technologies. Students are required to write some code/create a
          working prototype. We are not expecting a flushed out UI, but a program of some sort that accomplishes their
          implementation/solution to the problem is what we are aiming for. At the end of the three hours, each team
          will present (5 – 10 minutes) their solution to a small board of faculty and/or student members. The board
          will ask a few questions and ultimately vote on a winner. We will have a Google Meet call where students will
          present and gain the feedback mentioned earlier.
