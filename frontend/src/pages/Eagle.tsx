                <p>
                    Teams of two to four students will be working together to solve a problem
                    that is present in society and is awaiting a technological solution.
                    The students then have three hours to develop a solution using their knowledge
                    of computer science principles and technologies. Students are required to
                    write some code/create a working prototype. We are not expecting a flushed
                    out UI, but a program of some sort that accomplishes their implementation/solution
                    to the problem is what we are aiming for. At the end of the three hours,
                    each team will present (5 â€“ 10 minutes) their solution to a small board of faculty and/or student
                    members. The board will ask a few questions and ultimately vote on a winner. We
                    will have a Google Meet call where students will present and gain the feedback mentioned earlier.
