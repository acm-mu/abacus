            <p>
                Teams of two to four students will be working together to solve a problem that is present in society and is awaiting a technological solution. The students then have three hours to develop a solution using their knowledge of computer science principles and technologies. Students are not required to write code or create a working prototype, but rather have a flushed out, technical solution. At the end of the three hours, each team will present (5 â€“ 10 minutes) their solution to a small board of faculty members. The faculty will ask a few questions and ultimately vote on a winner. We will have a Google Meet call where students will present and gain feedback the feedback mentioned earlier.
