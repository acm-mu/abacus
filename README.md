# ðŸ§® Abacus

## Overview

This Open Source competition judging software is designed for the [Marquette ACM Programming Competition](https://mu.acm.org/competition). It was created by Marquette students, and modeled after [Kattis](https://www.kattis.com/), the judging software used for [ICPC](https://icpc.global/).

## Local Development

#### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) 

#### Installation
- Clone Abacus repo.

  `git clone https://github.com/acm-mu/abacus`

- Pull submodules ([piston](https://github.com/acm-mu/piston))

  `git submodule update --init`

- Startup docker containers

  `docker-compose up -d`

- Open a new web browser and go to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

Piston will take a couple of minutes to install language dependencies
You can watch the logs with `docker logs --follow piston` to wait for the setup to complete. (~10 minutes).

You can use Abacus while this is happening, but Piston will not work.

### Setting up Piston without Docker

Since v3 of Piston, the runtimes for piston are not installed by default. To install Python and Java, the docker
entrypoint bash script runs two POST requests to install Java and Python. These will need to be completed
manually to properly setup.

Python 3.9.4
```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"language\":\"python\", \"version\": \"3.9.4\"}" \
  localhost:2000/api/v2/packages
```
Java 15.0.2
```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"language\":\"java\", \"version\": \"15.0.2\"}" \
  localhost:2000/api/v2/packages
```
### Creating a new branch
- in your terminal/powershell, cd to the root of your abacus clone
- git checkout master
- git pull 
- git checkout -b initials-issue# (example - jd-101) 

After doing this, you should have your own branch created, and can now start working on changes!
